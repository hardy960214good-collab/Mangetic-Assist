#Here is problem 9 of IYPT(International Young Physicists' Tournament):
#  Attach one or two magnets to a non-magnetic and non-conductive base such that they attract a magnet suspended from a string. 
#  Investigate how the motion of the moving magnet depends on relevant parameters.
#These scripts derived the equation of motion of the swinging pendulum through the Lagrange Equation, calculated by scipy.
#Afterwards, a corresponding VPython animation is provided to visualize the computation.
